<h1> About Me</h1> <hr/> 
<p> Hello to whom ever is reading this. I'm not going to be too descriptive, just hitting the basics. </p>
  <h3> Family </h3>
    <p> I have a wife and 2 kids, ages 3 and 1 half. Leilani, my beautiful vivacious wife. We have been together since the summer of 2018. </p>
    <p> Waverly and Winnie, my 2 baby girls. Waverly is the first born and is a "girls girl princess little mama" to the max.</p>
    <p> Winnie is the second born and for now the last.  They are a year and 6 months apart. Winnie could not be more different than her big sis. She is a rough, tough, and a stinky little bean. Those two love to wrestle and play fight but dont be fooled by the age difference. Winnie holds her own, most of the time I'm having to get onto winnie for getting too rough with waves.   </p>
  <H3> Adolescence </H3>
    <p> I come from a family of 5. A mom, Dad, and 2 brothers. I am the youngest by far. My oldest brother Jacob is 10yrs older and my middle brother Jordan is 8yrs older. </p>
    <p> Growing up, my parents were in the height of their career so they were working a lot which left my brothers to "raise" me. They were tough, ruthless, and treated me like their pet. A lot of gory details that I wont get into right now. All in all I am grateful for the childhood I had, most definitely could of been worse. </p>
  <H3> Hobbies </H3> 
    <p> I enjoy, majority of outdoor activites, playing video games occasionaly, and most of all experiencing my girls grow up. </p>
