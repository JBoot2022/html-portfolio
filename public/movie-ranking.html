<H1>Josh's Most Favorite Movies </H1>
<H2> Top 3 Movies of all-time. </H2>
<hr />
<H3> The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</H3>
<P> The entire Lord of the Rings saga is my favorite but if I had to narrow it down to just 1 movie it would have to be the first hobbit. Due to the soundtrack and all of the beautiful choir like singing. With the cinematography and music combined really makes the movie enchanting.

<H3> Princess Mononoke </H3>
<P> This anime has such a beautiful story and some very important lessons. That combined with the breathtaking art makes for one of the best anime films I have ever seen.</P>
<H3> Transformers </H3>
<p> Now I know this pick is controversial but, this film has some deep ties to my childhood. When I watch it all of those warm fuzzy feelings that you get when reminiscing on good old memories come seeping into my veins. Its like siping warm broth on a cold day and you feel the rush of warmth engulf your stomach and reach to the ends of your fingertips.  </p>
